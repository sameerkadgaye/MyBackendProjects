/*
 Classloader: Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 
 		   	  which is used to load Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically. 
 			  It adds security by separating the package for the classes of the local file 
 			  system from those that are imported from network sources.
 			  
 			  
 bytecode verifier:	 
 			  Checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.
 			  
 			  OR
 			  
 			  The bytecode verifier acts as a sort of gatekeeper: 
 			  it ensures that code passed to the Java interpreter is in a fit state to be 
 			  executed and can run without fear of breaking the Java interpreter. ... 
 			  The types of the parameters of all bytecode instructions are known to always be correct.
